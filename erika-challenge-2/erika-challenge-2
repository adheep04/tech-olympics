Problem Statement:
-------------------
Your task is to design a program that processes the given data and produces a single output. 
The output should be a **summary of customer activity** based on the data provided.
There are multiple ways to approach this task, but thereâ€™s **one correct output**.
The winning team is the one who submits 

Objective: 
----------
Design a program that outputs the **total number of unique customers** who made purchases over a certain threshold 
and the **total amount of money spent** by these customers.

The **fake data** you will work with consists of transactions, and you need to:
- Identify the unique customers.
- Calculate the total amount spent by all those customers who made a purchase greater than a specified threshold (answer should be a single number).

Fake Data:
-----------
Here is the **fake transaction data** (for customers making purchases):

CustomerID, TransactionAmount, TransactionDate
C001, 120.00, 2024-03-01
C002, 75.00, 2024-03-01
C003, 180.50, 2024-03-01
C001, 90.00, 2024-03-02
C004, 55.00, 2024-03-02
C002, 50.00, 2024-03-02
C005, 200.00, 2024-03-03
C003, 50.00, 2024-03-03
C006, 250.00, 2024-03-03
C007, 300.00, 2024-03-04
C001, 110.00, 2024-03-04
C003, 220.00, 2024-03-04
C005, 125.00, 2024-03-05
C004, 95.00, 2024-03-05
C002, 250.00, 2024-03-05

---

Instructions:
-------------
1. Filter the transactions: 
   - Only consider customers whose **individual transaction** amount is greater than **$100**.
   
2. Track unique customers: 
   - You must **track** and only count customers who have made at least **one transaction greater than $100**.

3. Output Format:
   - **Total number of unique customers** who made at least one purchase greater than $100.
   - **Total amount spent** by those unique customers (sum of all their transactions).

---

Example Output:
---------------
For the provided fake data, you will produce a summary like this (based on the data given):

Unique Customers: _____
Total Money Spent: _____

---

Things to Consider:
-------------------
- Your solution should be flexible, allowing easy modifications if the dataset changes.
- Multiple approaches can be taken, make sure to brainstorm the best solution that matches your team's strengths before implementing
- The first team to get the correct answer for unique customers and $$ spent will recieve bonus points, but the winning team is the team with the best implementation.

Judging Criteria:
-----------------
- **Speed**: Did you get your solution to the judges in an effective time manner?
- **Correctness**: Does the program produce the right output?
- **Efficiency**: How well does your solution handle this data? Is it scalable to larger datasets?

Good luck! Please call a judge over if you have any questions on the problem or instructions!
